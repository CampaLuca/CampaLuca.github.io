I am a Cryptography PhD student at the University of Innsbruck (Department of Computer Science)


**Research interest**
I am mainly interested in design and cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives and their application to real world contexts e.g. industrial environments, IoT constraint devices and privacy preserving machine learning. Currently, I'm focusing my work on the usage of algebraic geometry for the cryptanalysis and design of symmetric key primitives in the context of privacy preserving protocols, namely ZK-Proofs (Zero Knowledge Proofs), MPC (Multi-Party Computation) and FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption). 

**Professional experiences**
Other than a PhD student, I'm a cryptography and OT security consultant since 3 years, and during those years I also worked as a cryptography teacher/tutor at the University of Udine in the context of the project [CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it/). Additionally, as part of my hobbies, I was a calisthenics trainer for 5 years.

**Education**
In October 18th, 2024 I received the MSc Double Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity at the University of Udine (Italy) and University of Klagenfurt (Austria). My master's thesis (*Algebraic cryptanalysis and its application to Arithmetization Oriented primitives*) was developed during an internship at the University of Innsbruck under the supervision of Professors Arnab Roy, Marino Miculan and Elisabeth Oswald. In 2017, I received the BSc in Computer Science at the University of Udine. 

**Projects and Awards**
In 2020 I was a finalist in the CyberChallenge.IT competition with the University of Udine. After that project, I funded [MadrHacks](https://www.madrhacks.org/), the CTF Team of the University of Udine, which is currently one of the [best CTF teams in Italy and worldwide](https://ctftime.org/team/114509).
